# Decision Tree Classifier on Diabetes Patients' Data

This project aims to predict Diabetes based on a comprehensive set of health indicators, such as glucose level, blood pressure, and insulin levels, among others. A Decision Tree Classifier model has been constructed to predict the presence or absence of the disease.

## Libraries Used

This project employs the following libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory data analysis was conducted to understand the data. Key steps undertaken include:

- Examination of data distribution through graphical and numerical methods, including assessment of skewness and kurtosis.
- Identification of outliers.
- Visualization the correlation between variables using a correlation matrix.
- Determination of feature importance to understand which features are most relevant.

## Model Selection

The aspects considered in selection of the model algorithm:

1. **Interpretability:** Decision trees provide clear and understandable rules for predicting diabetes, which can be beneficial in medical contexts where interpretability is crucial for gaining insights into the predictive factors contributing to diabetes.

2. **Handling Mixed Data:** Decision trees can effectively handle both numerical and categorical data, making them suitable for datasets with diverse data types.

3. **Feature Selection:**  Since Decision Trees inherently perform feature selection at each split, it be advantageous in high-dimensional dataset such as this one with multiple health indicators.

## Optimizing Decision Tree Performance

The following steps were adopted to improve the model's performance:

- Exploration of a range of tree depths to ascertain the optimal configuration, a step to mitigate underfitting or overfitting.
- Visualization with a line chart to illustrate the relationship between model accuracy and varying tree depths.
- Introduced additional parameters to further improve accuracy.

# Conclusion

In summary, the project focused on developing a Decision Tree Classifier model for diabetes prediction. Through exploratory data analysis, the data distribution, outliers, variable correlations, and feature importance were assessed.

Hyperparameters were iteratively fine-tuned to enhance predictive accuracy while mitigating overfitting or underfitting risks. Evaluation metrics, particularly accuracy, were pivotal in assessing model performance.

The findings highlight the potential of data-driven approaches in healthcare analytics. Moving forward, these insights can inform the development of more sophisticated predictive models and personalized healthcare interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
